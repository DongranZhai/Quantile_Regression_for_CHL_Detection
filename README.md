Detecting long-term trends in the extremes and variability of global and regional ocean chlorophyll concentrations using quantile regression model

Usage:
1. File 1-12 are R scripts for CHL data analysis and visualization. The same code is also applied in GlobColour dataset.
2. CHL_data contains pre-processed datasets: OC-CCI and GlobColour.
3. map_data contains the land map projection for visualization.
